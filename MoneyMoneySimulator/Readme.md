# Money Money Simulator
This program lets you simulate the Discovery Toys board game "Money Money".
It completly automated, and has been designed to be easy to modified/expanded upon.

There are currenty a few imperfections regarding the bank exchange system, but other than that, it is a 1:1 recreatation of the original game (board, rules, player actions, etc.).

For more information about how the game works, see [MoneyMoneyManual.md](MoneyMoneyManual.md).
