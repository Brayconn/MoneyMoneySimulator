(Paraphrased from original manual)
## Contents:
- 1 Gameboard 
- 1 Die (D6)
- 100 Plastic Coins (25 quarters, 25 dimes, 25 nickels, 25 pennies)
- 10 Play Dollar Bills
- 4 Tokens

## Setup:
- Each player rolls for turn order (highest number goes first, lowest number goes last)
- Add one of each coin (totaling to 41c) to the Money Money pot

## Rules:
1. Each player rolls the dice and moves their token that many spaces on the board. They then take an action based off of what type of space they landed on.
   - Money spaces:
      1. Spin the spinner on the board
      2. The player must now take the amount of money listed on the space, taking into account the restricion they spun on the spinner (No Nickels, No Dimes, No Quarters, or Any Coins)
      3. If the restriction spun on the spinner is "Money Money", the player may use any coins, but must put the money into the Money Money Pot on the board instead of into their wallet
   - Bank Exchange spaces:
      1. The player may now exchange their coins of a smaller value for one of a bigger value.
      2. If the player is able to make an exchange, they earn 10c "interest"
      3. (The original rules are unclear as to how many bank exchanges are allowed in a row, but language later on in the manual seems to imply only 1 per time landing on the space)
   - Dollar Sign spaces:
      1. The player who landed on the Dollar Sign space adds all the money from the Money Money pot to their wallet
      2. The Money Money Pot is then refilled with 41c (normally one of each coin) from the bank

## Winning:
1. The first player to cross the finish space collects the contents of the Money Money pot
2. The player with the most money wins!
